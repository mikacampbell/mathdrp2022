# Bayesian Inference on Infectious Disease in the Tropics
Mika Campbell, Marlin Figgins

GOALS:
1. To do a simple compartment model centered on influenza in the (tropics).
2. Background 
    - mechanism for disease spread in the tropics: new variants, waning immunity, temperature.
    - different types of models
3. Inference from the model created
    - numpyro (Jax)
    - stimulate data to recover parameters
    - test the model with new data
4. Model comparison
5. Conclusions 
    - about the entire project
