(Not all of these points will be put on the slide, but the general focus of this section is given.)

My name is Mika Campbell.
I am from Trinidad and Tobago (the tropics).

Relevance of this topic to me:

The H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009 - 2010 that significantly impacted the Caribbean. 
the % positivity during 2009 was 63% and in 2010 it impacted the population range:
 - Range: 24 - 66
 - Median age affected: 30 years

From 2011 - present, the positivity rate is 25%.
In Trinidad presently, the importance of getting the swine flu shot every year to prevent another outbreak. In that time, saw the evolution of public health in the island (which had not seen ab outbreak like this in decades) to predict how the disease moved in Trinidad (and the tropics, as a whole, and what measures could be taken to limit its spread).

My interest was piqued in this due to having to live through that pandemic (I was 7 years old at the time) and seeing how it has impacted public health today. Understanding the motives behind disease modelling has given me a newfound interest in the public health field and helped me to understand the rationale behind certain measures (when do we need vaccinations in teh population, when can we just take preventative measures etc.)
