Presentation OUTLINE:

1. Start with the Math (data)
    -  Using SIR to model influenza, why does this not work? Why does it not accurately represent real-life?
    - Show SIRS/ Two Variant Models - why do these give a better picture of what is happening?

2. Motivations for the project 
    - Background about me (tropics, influenza prevalence)
    - Using modelling as a way to understand the life around me

3. Go in depth about each of the models presented at the start (reference Background_Model_Types)
    - SIR Model 
    - SIRS Model 
    - Two Variant Model

4. How can we therefore, look at disease to understand how it moves?
    - Discuss the importance of compartments (reference Background_Model_Types) and the constants that we used to show how they all relate to one another to "build" the disease in question
    - Using mathematics to evaluate those compartments and their linked phenomena
    - Computer science tools?

5. Inference

6. How these models relate to real-life data
