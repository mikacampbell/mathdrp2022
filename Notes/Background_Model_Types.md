Background 

- Give some background about me (why disease modelling in the tropics was important to me)

1. Model Types

Models serve two main purposes to understanding disease: they can be used for prediction and/ or understanding.

Hence, in order to accurately evaluate the type of model needed, the disease and its influence must be broken down into its defining characteristics, called compartments. Compartments are parameters of the disease that interact in a speacific way during disease progression and transmission that give information as to how the disease operates in real life.

// Why did we pick them? - THese can be used to describe recurring epidemics.

Hence, there are three types of major models that wil be discussed:
1. The SIR Model 
    - Standard model
    - Compartments: Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered 
    When useful for diseases under specific conditions:
        - the disease is entering a naive population
        - it is impossible become susceptible to the disease after recovering from it (immunity is life-long)
        - there is no antigenic drift (the virus causing the disease does not mutate)
    // use * Overleaf (latex) to add equations for each model*
2. The SIRS Model (accounting for immunity/ immune waning)
    - Builds off the SIR model
    - Compartments: Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Back to Susceptible
    - When do we use the SIRS Model:
        - The population is not naive to the disease
        - Immunity is waning (it is possible to contract the disease again after having it)
3. The Two Variant Model
    - Evolved as a reuslt of antigenic drift
    - Antigenic drift: 
        -Small changes/ mutations in the genes of influenza viruses that can lead to changes in the physical (tertiary) structure of the antigen proteins of the virus. 
        - Since these antigens are recognized by the immune system and result in immune response, changing their structure, prevents the immune system from recognizing and blocking the symptoms of this disease. 
        - Mutation process occurs gradually (can occur over the course of a decade)
        - Since the diseases are related, the population may have some immunity to the new variant.
    - It eveloved to describe a very specific scenario in which a person's re-susceptibility to a virus stems as a result in changes in the virus (antigenic drift) versus waning immunity.
    - Is a very accurate way to model disease/ see the patterns in disease transmission as antigenic drift is a common phenomenon in recurring epidemics (influenza, gasoententeritis - virus mutates every 2 to 4 years) 



// Talk about how to extend this model to real data

2. Mechanisms of disease transmission

Factors that impact disease transmission:
- talk about the math at this point

- transmissability (represented by beta, stems )
